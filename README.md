# FlappyBirdPowers
This is a simple clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, built using React Native and Expo Go. The objective of the game is to control a bird that continuously falls due to gravity and must navigate through gaps between pipes. The player taps the screen to make the bird "jump" and avoid colliding with the pipes or falling to the ground.
